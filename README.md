<h1>Advent of Code 2024</h1>

Happy Holidays! ðŸŽ„ðŸ•Ž This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles. Each day brings a new challenge, and Iâ€™m using it as an opportunity to sharpen my skills in JavaScript and Python. Letâ€™s solve some puzzles and have fun along the way!

## Technologies Used
So far, Iâ€™ve tackled puzzles using both JavaScript and Python. I chose JavaScript because itâ€™s the language I use most frequently at the moment. I also decided to revisit Pythonâ€”my first programming languageâ€”so I donâ€™t get too rusty while continuing to dive deeper into JavaScript!

## Lessons Learned
Even on Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024, Iâ€™ve picked up a few valuable lessons while tackling the challenge. Here are some of the key takeaways so far:

1. **Debugging is Key**:  
   - Printing intermediate results to the console was crucial for debugging and understanding the problem better.  
   - Running multiple test cases helped me catch edge cases before submitting my final answer.
2. **Parsing Data Efficiently**:  
   - Many challenges required creative ways to parse and manipulate data. This pushed me to think critically about optimizing my approach.
3. **Refreshing Myself On Python**:  
   - While Iâ€™m comfortable with JavaScript, I realized I was rusty in Python. To challenge myself, I avoided looking at my JavaScript solutions when solving problems in Python.  
   - I re-learned how to read and write files in Python and revisited some of Python's powerful built-in methods, which proved to be incredibly useful.
4. **Improving `.gitignore` Usage**:  
   - I learned how to configure `.gitignore` to effectively ignore files nested within subdirectories using patterns like `**/filename`. This skill has improved my workflow and repository management.
